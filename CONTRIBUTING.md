# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Iso Survival! Please read these short guidelines before opening issues or PRs.

- Create issues for bugs/features with a clear title and steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- For code changes: fork the repo, create a feature branch, run local tests, and open a PR with a descriptive title.
- Keep changes small and focused; include unit tests where meaningful.
- Asset contributions (art, SFX, music) should be accompanied by a license statement. By default placeholder assets are MIT; for later releases we may move to a dual-licensing approach.
- Respect the age/content filters: no explicit nudity or pornographic content. We support family-friendly and adult versions via toggles/builds.

If you plan to contribute significant art/music assets, open an issue first so we can coordinate style and format.
