Assets folder structure:
- sprites/: 3x pixel character sprites, animations, and icon sheets
- tiles/: 64px 3D-rendered environment tiles (exported as textures)
- music/: soundtrack stems (indie-folk -> hip-hop hybrid)
- sfx/: footsteps, impacts, UI sounds

I will create initial placeholder pixel art and music stubs in the next step.
