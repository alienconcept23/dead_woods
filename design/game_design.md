# Game Design Notes (high-level)

## Core vision
- Premise: A camping trip goes wrong — players return to a transformed world (from suburb to hostile zone).
- Tone: post-apocalyptic / fantasy fusion; monsters: ghouls, beasts, draugr-like skeletons, knights, dragons.
- Player types: Candice, Maylee, Miles, Chris — starting perks/ability differences.

## Classes
- Melee: close combat, higher HP, sprint perks for Maylee.
- Shooter: ranged weaponry, high mobility.
- Magic: elemental effects, area control.

## Progression & Prestige
- Difficulty modes scale enemy stats and resource scarcity.
- Hardest difficulty = permadeath: lose inventory and return to start; completing story unlocks top-tier gear for future prestige runs.
- Each prestige run grants incremental gear upgrade and a prestige level.

## Building system
- Snap-grid building (snap points and modular parts), base persistence and defense mechanics.

## Audio
- Dark indie folk + shanty themes transitioning into hip-hop/beat-driven tracks during certain events.

## Notes
- Design for modularity: classes, items, enemies, quests must be data-driven (scriptable objects or JSON tables) so rules can change without rewriting systems.
