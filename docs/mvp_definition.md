# MVP Definition (concise)

The MVP is the minimal playable product that validates core design and technical choices. It must allow testers to:

- Start a solo or host a peer session and join others
- Move in the world, interact with the environment, and fight a simple enemy
- Place a few building pieces with snap-grid
- Save/load locally

Why we do this: it yields quick feedback on feel (movement/camera), network sync, and core loop viability before we invest in art, quests, and larger features.
